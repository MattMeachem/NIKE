the "Just do it" Script

the idea is to have an all in one script to deploy a working "Sheepdip" system with the ability to stand up some analyst toolsets in situ.
List of tools: https://cristian.sh/projects/forensictools.html

  *Install Forensictools (https://github.com/MattMeachem/forensictools)

  *Schedule Defender daily scan and weekly offline scan
  
  *Auto-build (all of the above)

  *Post installation checks/re-enable script blocking and to check all of the above have been successful
